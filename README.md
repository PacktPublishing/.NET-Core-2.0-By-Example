# .NET Core 2.0 By Example
This is the code repository for [.NET Core 2.0 By Example](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/net-core-20-example?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788395090), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
With the rise in the number of tools and technologies available today, developers and architects are always exploring ways to create better and smarter solutions. Before, the differences between target platforms was a major roadblock, but that's not the case now. .NET Core 2.0 By Example will take you on an exciting journey to building better software.

This book provides fresh and relevant content to .NET Core 2.0 in a succinct format that’s enjoyable to read. It also delivers concepts, along with the implications, design decisions, and potential pitfalls you might face when targeting Linux and Windows systems, in a logical and simple way.

With the .NET framework at its center, the book comprises of four varied projects: a multiplayer Tic-tac-toe game; a real-time chat application, Let'sChat; a chatbot; and a movie booking application. You will start each chapter with a high-level overview of the content, followed by the above example applications described in detail. By the end of each chapter, you will not only be proficient with the concepts, but you’ll also have created a tangible component in the application.

By the end of the book, you will have built four solid projects using all the tools and support provided by the .NET Core 2.0 framework.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.

For C# and .NET Core Samples:
Open the Packt.DotNetCore2ByExamples.Examples.sln solution file in Visual Studio 2017

For F# Project:
Open the F# sample project solution in Visual Studio 2017 and run the app.

For C++ and Ubuntu code samples:
Ubuntu Code samples should be downloaded and opened with Visual Studio Code.
C++ ExampleDll solution can be directly opened in Visual Studio 2017.

The code will look like the following:
```
# include<stdio.h>

int hello()
{
  return 15;
}
```

This book is aimed at experienced developers who use different platforms—Windows, Linux, Ubuntu, macOS—and want to try Microsoft .NET Core 2.0 cross platform. Developers using C#, C, or C++ for development who are interested in extending their knowledge of functional programming, beginners who want to understand F# and functional programming, we assume that you have a basic understanding of C# and are aware of the .NET framework and Windows.

The below section summarizes the chapter wise content and demo links.
